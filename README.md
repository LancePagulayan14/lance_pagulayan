This sudoku solver is just a little project that I decided to make in order to practice my java skills.
This code uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any sudoku puzzle.
Works by changing the numbers in the grid at the top and then running the code using any IDE of your choice
Still needs improvement, but it is a start
I would like to create a driver for it but don't know where to start.
